# How To Think Like A Developer

## Approaches to software development
- Waterfall model
- Iterative model



## User Stories

As a user...
I should be able to...
So that...


As a user, I should be able to call one of my contacts
As a user, I should be able to see my message history
As a user, I should be able to sort contacts by name
As a user, I should be able to edit a contact
As a user, I should be able to group contacts
As a user, I should be able to add a photo to a contact
As a user, I should be able to email a contact
As a user, I should be able to report a contact to a supervisor
As a user, I should be able to export contact list
As a user, I should be able to import contacts
As a user, I should be able to schedule a meeting with a contact
As a user, I should be able to "poke"
As a user, I should be able to add social media accounts to a contact
As a user, I should be able to share a contact






## Prioritize

- MUST HAVE
As a user, I should be able to find a contact
As a user, I should be able to see a list of contacts
As a user, I should be able to add contacts


- SHOULD HAVE
As a user, I should be able to delete contacts
As a user, I should be able to search contacts

- COULD HAVE

- WON'T HAVE





## Define Objects in our system

- Once you're more familiar with the process of planning a system this step will come early on
- Today, we'll start writing code and iteratively move toward an object-oriented system







## CRM User Stories

- As a user, I am presented with a prompt to 'add', 'modify', 'display all', 'display contact', display attribute', 'delete' and 'exit'.

- As a user, if 1 is typed, I am prompted to give my 'first name', 'last name', 'email' and 'notes'.

- As a user, if 2 is typed, I am prompted to enter a contact attribute to be modified.

- As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to type 'yes' or 'no' to confirm my selection.

- As a user, if 'yes' is typed, I am prompted to change 'id', 'firstname', 'lastname' and 'email'.

- As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to enter a new value for the attribute.

- As a user, if 'no' is typed, I am returned back to the main menu.

- As a user, if 'display all' is typed, I am shown all of the contacts that exist.

- As a user, if 'display contact' is typed, I am shown a particular contact.

- As a user, if 'display attribute' is typed, I am prompted to enter an attribute so that I can see all of the contacts according to that attribute.

- As a user, if 'delete' is typed, I am prompted to enter an attribute value of the contact to be deleted.

- As a user, if 'exit' is typed, I am exited out of the program and returned to the command line.
