## Good habits for avoiding bugs
- write short bits of code at a time and run the program frequently
- staying organized: each method and class has a single responsibility (so you know where to look)
- close thing as soon as you open them (ends, closing <tags>)
- pair programming/code review
- try things out in irb first
- plan things out
- use binding.irb in your



## Debugging techniques
- taking a break
- ask for help
- simplifying or modifying the problem code
- try things out in irb
- read the error message (line number, message, stack trace, suggestions for correction)
- read the docs
